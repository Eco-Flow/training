## Setup of training environment

Next, you will need to test whether you can log-in to the Gitpod VS code training environment. 
This is a free coding environment (10 hours per month, or more if you link your LinkedIn to the account), for testing and developing code, but also for training. It has all the code installed and files you need to complete the course.

To access Gitpod you may need to use your phone to verify who you are.

Click the following link:

and follow the instructions.

If you are on our VSCode Gitpod training environment, spend 10 minutes getting to know the environment.
Go to the VSCode website to learn about what you can do in VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface

Remember to close the browser window when you are done, but remember that this will end your session, so make sure to save anything you wish before you close the browser.
