# Setup

For this course you require just three things:

1. A browser (ideally chrome based, e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft edge, Brave, etc.)

2. A Github account (https://github.com/join)

3. A stable internet connection

Next, you will need to test whether you can access the Gitpod training environment we will use to run the training course. This is a controlled environment with all the code and files needed installed and ready to go. 

To access Gitpod you may need to use your phone to verify who you are. 

Click the following link (https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/Eco-Flow/training/tree/main) and follow the instructions. 

Choose Login with Github and enter your credentials.

If you see the following screen you know you are into Gitpod. 

You are now ready to move to [Step 1 command line basics](../docs/commandline.md). 

If you have failed to get to this point, please shout out to the tutor!
