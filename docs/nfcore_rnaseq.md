# Running a nf-core pipeline

In this final practical, we will show you how to run a nf-core pipeline. nf-core set the standard for building gold standard, reproducible data pipeline, and have become the industry standard for processing RNA-Seq and other common "omics" data types.

They are made up of the efforts of the entire community, and are coordinated by a dedicated team at nf-core. For those beginning their bioinformatics journey, they are a super useful way to get the heavy lifting of bioinformatics done in an efficient way.

The example we will go through is the standard RNA-Seq pipeline which is located here:
