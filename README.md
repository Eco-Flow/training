# Eco-Flow Basic Nextflow Training

To start learning a bit about bioinformatics pipeline development, this course aims to give you the base knowledge you would need to conduct and run your own nf-core pipelines, assuming limited previous bioinformatics knowledge.

**Step 1.** Command line basics (practical)

**Step 2.** Pipeline background knowledge (lecture)

**Step 3.** RNA-Seq background knowledge (lecture)

**Step 4.** Nextflow background knowledge (lecture)

**Step 5.** Run an nf-core RNA-Seq pipeline (practical)
